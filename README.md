# Description
This userscript for Twitch allows you to load [ChitChat](https://chitchat.ma.pe/) as the default Chat for any stream.

## How does it work?
The script does check if the Twitch chat got loaded on a website and then replaces it with ChitChat (which is developed by [mape](https://github.com/mape)). I did not develop ChitChat and I can't fix any bugs or features that are provided by ChitChat.

# Installation
